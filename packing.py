'''Discreet 3-Dimensional perfect packer.

This module contains the code to generate the rotations on a set of pieces, and
to ensemble them into a defined cuboid.

def pack(blocks, space):
    '''Pack the blocks on the space and return a matrix with the positions.
    
    Parameters:
    * blocks: A tuple with:
      * An identifier (a string will do).
      * A matrix of booleans. It should be like this: [][][].
    * space: A tuple with three ints, (x, y, z), that define the environment.
       
    The assumptions are:
    * A block is a cuboid of boolean values.
    * The space is a cuboid.
    * The blocks can enter perfectly on the space.
    * The blocks, as well as the space, are composed of discreet units.
    
    Variables x, y, and z are modelled this way (they are a 3-D projection!):
    
    y
    
    ^    z
    |   /
    |  /
    | /
    |/
    o----------> x
